# Python Master Race
Python Master Race is a game based on the mobile game Snake vs Block developed using Java and Slick2D as the game library

## GAME MECHANICS
### Initial State
The game starts immediately, with the snake having a life points of 10, rendering block numbers randomly, where there is always a possible route forward.
### Game Objective
The objective of the game is to be the last player standing while traversing the course by passing through numbered blocks using the snake’s life to penetrate.
### Player Types and Actions
Different players will be distinguished by the color. A player’s “snake” will be clearly visible while other player’s will be faded. The snake automatically moves forward, where the player can opt to move to the left or right to choose which box to pass through and gather additional “life”.
### Player Status and Scoring/Performance Evaluation
The player will be scored based on distance reached and remaining snake life
### Endgame
The game only ends when each of the players’ snake’s length or life is extinguished
